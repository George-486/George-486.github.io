     <center><h2 style="color: white;">YouTube, a video-sharing website originating in the United States, is currently the world's largest online video platform. Its name is a combination of "you" and "tube." Originally designed as a dating and video-sharing platform, it later became a video-sharing website and gained widespread popularity. In November 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion. Google's subsequent influence in the digital content industry has made it one of the world's largest user-generated content platforms.</h2></center>

     <center><h2 style="color: white;">In its early days, the website's slogan was "Broadcast Yourself," and its logo was inspired by an early cathode-ray tube television. After several official revisions, it now features a flat red play button. In August 2018, YouTube was ranked the second most popular website in the world by a third-party organization.</center></h2>
